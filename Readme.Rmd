This Readme offers guidance as to the implementation of `run_analysis.txt` and use of `CodeBook.md`.


This Repository contains `run_analysis.R` an R Script for cleaning the dataset provided at the following link: `http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones`. 

The R Script `run_analysis.R` will work following download of the compressed data file and extraction of the data in the same strcture as compressed. 

The working directory where this extracted data must then be set before running the script; it will move between the folders automatically. 

`CodeBook.md` provides detail of the process taken to combine and clean the data set before exporting the file `Column Means By Activty By Subject.txt` to the Working Directory as set at the start.
